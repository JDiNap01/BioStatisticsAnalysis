## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Getting the Data

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
# Get the Data

food_consumption <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-02-18/food_consumption.csv')

# Or read in with tidytuesdayR package (https://github.com/thebioengineer/tidytuesdayR)
# PLEASE NOTE TO USE 2020 DATA YOU NEED TO USE tidytuesdayR version ? from GitHub

# Either ISO-8601 date or year/week works!

# Install via devtools::install_github("thebioengineer/tidytuesdayR")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2020-02-18')
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2020, week = 8)


food_consumption <- tuesdata$food_consumption
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
