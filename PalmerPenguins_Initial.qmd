## *Palmer Penguins*

This document analysizes different populations of penguins and their relative weights and sizes. This is my first notebook.

## Running Code

Here we will load the tidyverse package and paenguins dataset

```{r}
#Load the tidyverse
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)

#Read the penguins_samp1 data file from github
penguins <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcduryea/Intro-to-Bioinformatics/main/data/penguins_samp1.csv")

#See the first six rows of the data we've read in to our notebook
penguins %>%
  head() %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(c("striped","hover"))
```

The different tables are organized by species, the island the species was found, its bill length and depth, flipper length and depth, the body mass, year of discovery, and sex.
